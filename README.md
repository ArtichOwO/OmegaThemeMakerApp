## How do I use this thing ?
On the left side of the interface, you will be able to find all the color related code from the OS, and you will then be able to change
the hexadecimal values in order to change the color of the different elements of the interface. If you want to see how the colors fits in, you just have to press the "play" button to launch the simulator.
the "file" icon next to the play button will allow you to load a work taht you have previously saved using the floppy-disk button.
The right click is fully functionnal and will provode you with a full context menu that allows you to change a color without having to know by heart it's hexadecimal value.
